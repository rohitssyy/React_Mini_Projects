# Color Picker Project

## Overview

The **Color Picker** project is a simple and intuitive tool that allows users to select and customize colors. It provides an interactive interface where users can pick colors using a color palette, sliders, or by entering specific color codes (e.g., HEX, RGB). This project is ideal for developers, designers, or anyone who needs to work with colors.

## Features

## How It Works

4. **Clipboard Functionality**: Users can copy the color code with a single click.
