# Digital Clock Project

## Overview

The **Digital Clock** project is a simple and elegant tool that displays the current time in real-time. It provides a clean and responsive interface, making it suitable for use as a desktop or web-based clock. This project is ideal for learning React hooks and practicing real-time updates in web applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: The clock updates every second to display the current time.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices of all screen sizes.
- **Customizable**: Modify the code to change the clock's appearance or add additional features like date display or time zones.

## How It Works

1. **Time Calculation**: The clock uses JavaScript's `Date` object to fetch the current time.
2. **React Hooks**: The `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage and update the time dynamically.
3. **Live Feedback**: The interface updates every second to reflect the current time.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: To simplify and speed up web application development.
- **React**: For handling real-time updates and user interactions.
- **CSS**: For styling the clock and making it visually appealing.
